    "title": "Using FMOD with WebGL | Games.GrumpyBear.FMOD.Utilities",
    "keywords": "Using FMOD with WebGL Using FMOD with WebGL has some special requirements and limitations. FMOD must be initialized through an action, which comes from direct user input, e.g. the user clicking a button. All FMOD banks must be loaded before interacting with them. FMOD should be suspended and resumed on focus events to prevent audio glitches. See more details in Fix blocked FMOD audio in Browsers and Scripting Examples | Asynchronous Loading This package provides two classes for helping with implementing this right. WebGLInitializer WebGLInitializer handles initialization of FMOD and bank loading. Usage: Set InitializeOnEnable to false on all VolumePreference instances in the editor. Create an empty scene with a camera, a canvas and a button. Give the button a label like \"Start Game\" or similar. Create a new GameObject with WebGLInitializer . In the editor, configure WebGLInitializer . This is easiest done by clicking the \"Fix All Problems\" button. (Optionally) Style and decorate the scene any way you want. Save this scene and make it the first scene in the build settings . When started, WebGLInitializer will load the first scene asynchronously and wait for the FMOD banks to load. The button is kept hidden until both scene and FMOD banks are ready. When the player clicks the button, FMOD is initialized (thus fulfilling the requirement of direct under interaction), and switches to the real first scene. Important Make sure to configure FMOD banks to load automatically under Initialization -> Load Banks in the FMOD Settings ( FMOD -> Edit Settings ) FocusManager When a Unity application loses focus in WebGL, e.g. the user switches to a different tab, FMOD gets stuck playing the same sounds. FocusManager is class, which helps handle unfocus and focus events correctly by suspending and resuming FMOD. Simply add FocusManager to a GameObject in your active scene. Tip It's recommended to keep the FocusManager in a global scene, if you're using a multi-scene setup."
